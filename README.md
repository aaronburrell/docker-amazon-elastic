# Docker Scripts for the Amazon Distro of Elasticsearch and Kibana
  
  I plan on updating this project periodically. It currently is
  only a basic deployment of Amazon's version of Elasticsearch.
  
## Items List in Folder

> docker-compose.yml - Full install of distro products

> run-elasticsearch.sh - Start Elasticsearch in a docker container

> connect-to-elasticsearch.sh - Verify Elasticsearch is running
